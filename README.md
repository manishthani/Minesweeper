# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a game built developed in the Software Architecture Course at UPC. 
It is built in Java using the Hibernate framework and the main objective of this project is to apply different software patterns 
in a 3-tier architecture and apply it to build a classical fun game.
We encourage you to have a look at it and play it!
